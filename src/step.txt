first go to index.css and do some styling 
we will start by creaing the display based on mobile dimensions and convert it into a web one
now create components
set the dimensions in app.css of the app set overflow-x hidden
to not let scrollbar be there due to over flow we use .App::-webkit-scrollbar be display none

// header components
it this 5 container will be there
1. logo img
2. input container
3. shopping cart container
4. profile container
5. barChart container

then we do the styling

// main containercreate 2 containers 
1. main
2. rightside one

//footer components
it has 2 components
1. main
2. buttomMemu

now bottomMenu will contain the lsit of items and icons we will give those as a prop to the component element and the icons will come from material ui
note that the icon is declared as an element
go and style the footer now 

now give properties to the li in the MenuforFooter.css
after that go to footer and manage the indicator

-----------------i rremoved it---------------------------
now in footer to make the clicked list item active we will use the useEffect which takes document.queryseectorLL which selects all the li element itmes now to itemate each li we will use foreach fuction that will create an eventListener for each item and a fuction call setMenuactive is passed in it so that we can make changes on which the button is clicked. under that function we will remove all the active classNAme using tha foreach loop and the we add the current clicked button active class to it

// main container
so first we will make the banner - banner is different for differnet user so we will make a seperate component for it. and the banner will be taking 3 different properties name,discount link which is going to be different for all users
now we crate the banner and now we will style it

now in main.js we will create the dishcontainer containeing 3 components
1. menu card which containes menuListheading  - we gave props to it as we can reuse the same componenets giving different props to it
2. rowContaainer which containes menuitems
3. DisItemcontainer

after the MenuCard we will do row container which containes the menu items
this will be called as menuItems which contains 3 things img heading and an icon

set the above 3
once those are set give the menuItems 3 props name, imgSrc and isActive

isActive is to give them active class so as to give effect or by hovering also the effect can be seen

now go and and import data.js in Main.js
now if the data.id is 1 then isActive is true else false

now map the data items to the element so that it appears one by one and give props accordingly

//dishItemContainer section----------

it will have 2 container
2.imgBox
3.imgContent it will have name rating and one cart + icon 

in rating we will use array.apply form null to 5 and use a map which will have 2 params e,i i is for giving key a unique value and
map will have an i element containg a star icon
rating and price should come under bottom class
now make a usestate isMainDat in main.css and give it a variable which will filter the option we have clicked from the rowContainer as it will change the name of the input to the selected ones

then we create a setData function which when we click any item it filters the whole suggestion as when we click its id is being sent to the function and that function then filter the items based comparing the selected id and set the filterred data to the setIsMainData

now create the right menu with card and cartItems in it
then after the cartItem section we put totalSection below cartItem
afterr all that add the rightMenu to active and use transform in it

then go to header section and put the onclick functionality where u will querySelect the .rightMenu and will add classList.toggle(.active) so that when u toggle it gives active and when u toggle again it gets removed

now we want to add item we click in the itemMenu to display in the rightMenu so we will use redux - go and understand what is happening  // still need to understand what reduxx is

now create a useState qty in CartItem and write the ifelse

now make it responsive
